## API documentation

Before using the SSAP API for the first time, we strongly recommend that you learn the main concepts of the Sofia2 platform. They have been included in the Sofia2 developer documentation, which can be downloaded from http://sofia2.com/desarrollador_en.html.

## Build instructions

The Android API is distributed as a maven project. Its artifact can be built and installed in the local maven repository using the following commands:

```
cd <root of your copy of the repository>
mvn clean install [-Dmaven.test.skip]
```

## Android Studio dependencies

Upon build, place the resulting .jar under the libs directory of your Android project. Then you need to update your build.gradle file inside the app directory with these lines:
```
  repositories {
      mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
      compile 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.5'
      compile 'org.fusesource.hawtbuf:hawtbuf:1.11'
      compile 'org.fusesource.hawtdispatch:hawtdispatch:1.22'
      compile 'org.fusesource.hawtdispatch:hawtdispatch-transport:1.22'
      compile 'org.fusesource.mqtt-client:mqtt-client:1.14'
      compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs:jackson-jaxrs-json-provider:2.8.6'
      compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.8.6'
      compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.8.6'
      compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.8.6'
      compile files('libs/ssap-android-1.1.0.jar')
  }
```
